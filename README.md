# Wireless-Signal-Propagation-Analysis-and-Modeling

Objective: The project is focused on analyzing and modeling signal propagation in wireless communication, specifically to understand how signal strength decays over distance in different environments.

Environments: It considers two types of environments:

Line-Of-Sight (LOS): Where there is a clear, unobstructed path between the transmitter and receiver.
Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS): Where obstacles partially or fully block the path, causing signal loss.
Key Calculations:

Path Loss: The reduction in signal strength as it travels from the transmitter to the receiver, calculated using a reference distance and frequency.
Propagation Exponent (Alpha): A parameter that describes how rapidly the signal strength decreases with distance. It is different for LOS and NLOS conditions.
Standard Deviation (Sigma): A measure of how much the signal strength varies from the expected path loss model, indicating the level of unpredictability in the signal behavior.
Data Handling:

The project uses measurement data for LOS and NLOS conditions and adjusts this data for analysis.
It computes the propagation exponent and standard deviation to better understand and model the signal behavior.
